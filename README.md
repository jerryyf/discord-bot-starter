# discord-bot-starter
Starter framework from [discord.js](https://discordjs.guide/) adapated TypeScript for implementing bot slash commands in Discord. Abstracted as a module for use with index files.

## Usage
[discord.js](https://discordjs.guide/) only briefly covers TypeScript implmentation. `Client` is extended through `CustomClient.ts` for simplicity.
